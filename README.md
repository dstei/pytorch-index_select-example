Use torch's index_select for word embeddings

Dealing with torch.index_select came up when doing assignment 3 of [Stanford's CS224n course](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/). This is a python script showing how `torch.index_select()` works and how it can be used, together with `torch.view()`, to embed a list of words with word vectors.
